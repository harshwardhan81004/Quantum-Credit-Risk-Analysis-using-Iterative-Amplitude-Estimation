# Quantum-Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-Iterative-Amplitude-Estimation
Classical vs Quantum Expected Loss, VaR, and CVaR Benchmarking


Overview

This repository contains a complete Credit Risk Analysis workflow implemented using both classical machine learning and quantum algorithms.

The system estimates three core risk metrics:

Expected Loss (EL)
Value at Risk (VaR)
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

Classical PDs are predicted using a trained credit-scoring model. LGD values are taken directly from the German Credit Dataset.
The quantum pipeline uses Iterative Amplitude Estimation (IAE) and quantum state preparation to estimate the loss distribution.

This project investigates numerical alignment between classical and quantum risk estimators — a required step before any potential quantum speedup.
